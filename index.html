            <h1> My Experiences in the Navigators at UGA </h1>
            <h4> By Scott Bailey </h4>
        </div>
        <h4>What is the Navigators?</h4>
        <dl><dt>The Navigators:</dt>
        <dd> An international Christian organization that works to spread the gospel of Christ.
        It exists on college campuses, in major cities, in foreign countries, and much more.
        </dd></dl>
        <h3> The Community on Campus: </h3>
        <p>
        I found the Navigators when I was a freshman. I was invovled in a few campus ministries and organizations at the time and wasn't sure where I would stay involved. 
        I was drawn to the Navs, because all of the people seemed intentional, genuine, and friendly. 
        As a freshman I was looking for a group that would encourage me to grow in my faith, but also feel like home on campus. 
        The Navigators is where I found just that. 
        My roommate and I joined a Bible study and all of these guys quickly became my closest friends. 
        As I became more involved, I got to know more and more people in the ministry.
        This went beyond my small Bible study to a large group on campus. 
        The Navs meet weekly for worship and a message, but small groups of people typically meet throughout the weeek to spend time together.
        The Navs welcomed me in freshmen year and gave me a close group of genuine friends for the rest of my time in college. 
        </p>
        <h3> The Summer Training Program: </h3>
        <p>
            After my freshman year, I joined Navs from colleges all over the South East to spend the summer in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. 
            Here we spent 8 weeks living in a hotel, working at Dollywood, and going through siminars. 
            This summer was a very unique experience for me.
            We were all placed on teams of four people from different schools, one was the team leader and the other three team members.
            The team leader spent the summer mentoring the three team members and investing in them. 
            These teams lived in the same hotel room together, were a Bible study for the summer, and spent a lot of time intentionally getting to know one another more and more.
            My team became very close very fast.
            We all had been through similiar things and our personalities matched. I made a lot of great friends during my Summer Training Program, but on my team, we became a group of brothers that summer. 
            In Tennessee that summer, I learned a lot about who I want to be, what I believe, and how to take it back to college. 
            This Summer Training Program became one of the greatest experiences so far. 
        </p>
        <h3> Becoming a Leader in the Navs: </h3>
        <p>
            After my experiences in Tennessee, I felt the need to become a leader in the Navigators at UGA. 
            When I returned to college, I began meeting with freshmen guys to mentor them and invest in them as people had done for me in the past. 
            I read the Bible with them and talked through life testimonies and challenges they faced. 
            My second semester of my sophomore year I was asked to join the leadership group in Navs and the next year I was asked to help lead the freshmen guy Bible study. 
            Leading my Bible study and mentoring younger students has been such a positive influence on my life. 
            I get to be a part of what I believe God is doing in their lives and I get to invest in these guys as others have invested in me.
            It truly is a blessing to be a part of that.
